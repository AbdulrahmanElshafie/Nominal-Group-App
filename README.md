# Nominal Group App

## Nominal Group 
### What's Nominal Group?
A Flutter project that implements the "Nominal Group" technique. This technique is used for various situations when working with teams during discussions, brainstorming, and ideation processes. 

### When to use the Nominal Group Technique?
-  Some group members are much more vocal than others
-  Some group members think better in silence
-  There is concern about some members not participating
-  The group does not easily generate quantities of ideas
-  Some or all group members are new to the team
-  The issue is controversial or there is a heated conflict between team members

### Nominal Group Steps
1.  Stating the problem/discussion topic
2.  Each team member thinks about solutions/ideas/etc
3.  Each one adds his solution/idea to a piece of paper
4.  The organizer takes all papers and opens the discussion for each one as follows
    1.  Each one tells his opinion/comment one by one without any interruptions
5.  After all team members have finished, each one of the team sets a score for each idea/votes for each idea with yes or no
6.  Then the organizer takes the results and tells the solution with the highest score
